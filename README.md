# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions. The purpose of the study will be to determine whether water gotten from different water bodies is safe for human consumption given the various water quality  metrics.


# OBJECTIVES
## Main Objective:
To predict whether water is safe for human consumption or not.


## Specific Objectives:
To inspect the strength and character of the relationship between the various water quality metrics and whether water is safe for consumption or not.
To compare how the various supervised models  perform when classifying the target variable.
Determine which unsupervised learning techniques are suitable for the dataset analysis.
To identify the different contributions by the features given and determine which features have the greatest contribution to water potability(feature importances).

# Data Source
The dataset used for analysis was obtained from the following kaggle
